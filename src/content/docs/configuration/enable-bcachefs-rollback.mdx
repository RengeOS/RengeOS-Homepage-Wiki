title: Enable Bcachefs Rollback
---

**Bcachefs** is basically quite similar to the Btrfs we know, and if you want to learn more about it,
you can read here: <a href="https://bcachefs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bcachefs Filesystem</a>

<br />

**Currently**, there's no clear explanation online for how to take snapshots of the / directory system in bcachefs,
so we can now enable snapshots for bcachefs by running the `bcachefs-rollback` hook of mkinitcpio for initramfs.
<br />
**Thanks** to [**@bathtime**](https://github.com/bathtime) for coming up with this method ❤️

## Let's proceed
<br />
**First**, we need to ``git clone`` this source before proceeding.

```sh
cd /tmp/ && git clone https://github.com/RengeOS/Bcachefs-Rollback-Initramfs
```
**Next**, we will install it by building it from source code with ``makepkg -si``.

```sh
cd Bcachefs-Rollback-Initramfs/ && makepkg -si
```
**After** the package build and installation process is successful, our task is to restart the entire system.

```sh
# you can replace reboot to 'systemctl reboot' if not working
reboot
```
