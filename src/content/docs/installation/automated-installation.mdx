title: Automated Installation
---
**Essentially**, we'll use ros-installer to automate the installation process from a Live ISO to the machine using the ``unsquashfs`` method.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note">
  **Currently**, only offline installation is supported,
  and there are no plans to switch the installation process to online for the following reasons:
+ **Online installation** can be quite risky if the network encounters problems during the installation process,
  such as installing a package, as restarting the process would be very inconvenient.
+ The **online installation** process is not compatible with the original design of this distribution (RengeOS).
+ Maintaining **other packages** and **infrastructure** using online methods would be quite expensive for me :(
